For the problem Sales Taxes it was immediately clear that the primary issue would be accurately parsing the text to gather and organize data. First, the program uses regular expressions to convert each line into an object containing multiple properties. Secondly, the program compares and consolidates each line entry into category objects. Lastly, the category objects are referenced and formatted for display on the page. I went with the assumption that the input would likely be manually entered, which neccessitates the use of input sanitization and error messaging.
